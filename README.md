# SimplePhot

This is a basic pipeline for reducing (flat and bias correcting) and extracting time-series photometry from astronomical imaging data. The software is written in IDL, and makes use of routines from the [NASA IDL Astronomy Users Library](http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov).

SimplePhot was started as a bet with [Conor Sayres](http://depts.washington.edu/astron/profile/sayres-conor/) at the *[Route 66 Lounge](http://www.yelp.com/biz/route-66-lounge-sunport)* in the Albuquerque airport.
